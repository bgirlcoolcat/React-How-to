# React - How to examples
This repo supports my learning of React, and my notes stored in Evernote under the heading React - How to...

## Set up
To set up an environment for working with React, I used the create-react-app package [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Unnecessary files were deleted. See the 'Use create-react-app' notes in Evernote.

Changes to the remaining files were:

### App.js
I deleted all the code, and started from scratch. See the 'Use create-react-app' notes in Evernote.

### index.js
To see basic file set up, see initial commit and the 'Use create-react-app' notes in Evernote.
Mainly involved removing the line
     import './index.css';

### index.html
To see basic file set up, see initial commit and the 'Use create-react-app' notes in Evernote which provides replacement code to use.

## See git commit history
I plan to git commit examples as I work along with learning resources.
